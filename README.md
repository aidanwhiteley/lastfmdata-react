# LastFmData-React

A work in progress to re-implement an SPA display of LastFm "scrobble" data using React. 

A previous version using AngularJS is available at https://github.com/aidanwhiteley/lastfmdata.

This is a first attempt at doing something practical with React and comes with the caveat that I'm only halfway through the React course at https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux. The plan is to change over to using Redux, Hooks and actually write some tests when I've learnt how.
